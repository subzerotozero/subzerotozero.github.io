Welcome to my road from Sub-Zero to Zero.

Where most people grow from Zero to Hero, my goal is grow from far below zero to a baseline zero.

For the past 36 years of my life I've been living sedentary, with a sitting job and sitting pasttimes, occasionally I've dabbled into some sport, but never more than a year at a time and never to an acceptable level.  
2024 will be the year I finally change this, as a father of three young children it's my responsibility to be there for them. Having a baseline of fitness is part of this, as well as not dying to a heart-attack before I turn 40.  

On February 1st 2024 I registered myself to join the Open Lakes triathlon in Belgium, it's a Promo distance (500m swim, 21 km bike and 5 km run) triathlon and the event is very "first-timer" friendly from what I've read.

Along my way I'll be attempting to better my fitness in a safe way and a way that's easily combined with young parenthood and a fulltime job.

Steps I will take to accomplish my goals:

* Core stability and flexibility through at-home kettlebell training
* Swimming practice once a week, learning technique by watching YouTube and possibly getting a trainer for some sessions down the line
* Combining a school run with an actual run at least once a week
* Combining a school bike run with an actual bike run at least once a week
* Starting March or April a brick bike-run on fridays


At this time I do not have:
* Any fitness level
* A decent enough bike
* Freestyle swimming experience
* Kettlebell(s)
* Massive amounts of training time
* The freedom to train just whenever, trainings will need to be planned meticulously in order to fit in the family planning puzzle, while reducing disturbance

In this blog I'll keep myself accountable, I'll document my journey for me or others to follow along.
