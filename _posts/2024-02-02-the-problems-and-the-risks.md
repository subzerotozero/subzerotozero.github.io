# What needs to happen in order to succeed?

* I need a bike, preferably one that allows me to do casual schoolruns as well as do some training sessions and the actual event, without breaking the bank
* I need to learn how to swim freestyle comfortably
* I need to lose weight through eating less
* I need to plan my time efficiently
* I need to forgive myself for making mistakes or missing trainings, eating badly
* I need to drastically lower my coke zero intake

# How do I plan on doing this?

* Before middle of February I need to have a bike
* I'll be learning freestyle swimming from YouTube at first, basic technique should be enough to get me through 500m of swim
* I'll reduce intake of both breakfast and lunch to a combined 800-900 kcals and will be fairly free to consume a regular family dinner
* I plan trainings around times where I would be out of the house anyway, as to not impact my family life
* I'll gradually reduce my coke zero intake, aiming at march where I would like to consume a maximum of 0,5L/day, replacing cravings with water
